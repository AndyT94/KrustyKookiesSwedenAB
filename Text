The database manager used is SQLite. The tabs and windows in the GUI are inspired and is a modified version of the solution to lab 3. The GUI calls methods in the Database class which executes the query and returns data if any.

The pallet tab is used to keep track and search for specific pallets. The order tab shows the orders and the storage tab shows the raw material storage. In the delivery tab you can add raw material deliveries and in shipment you can mark a pallet as delivered to a customer.
